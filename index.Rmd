# Bookdown

## Code Styling

Have tried everything to control the background color of code chunks as in myslidy.css (see d3 lectures folder) to no avail.  Gitbook appears to work differently.

I can control some things but not all.

Works:

```
  pre {
    font-size: 200%;
    font-weight: bold;
    width: 80%;
  }

  .sourceCode {
   font-size: 200%;
   width: 40%;
}
```

Doesn't work:

```
  pre {
    font-family: "Times New Roman";
    border-color: green;
    color: orange;
    background-color: green;
  }
```

This works for `<div class="sourceCode">` not
`<pre class="sourceCode">`

```
.sourceCode {
   background-color: green;
}
```

## Font Awesome

Use only 5.1.0 or earlier
